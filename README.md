## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jozsef Simco, a passionate web developer with a keen interest in modern web technologies and best practices. 

- ðŸ”­ I have just finished https://postgenerator.io/ where users can create social media post, preview them, save them for later use or just edit them. It is a PHP Laravel, React, Inertia, Vite, OpenAI, Stripe project. :) I'm sure the code would require more refactoring and clean code practices could be improved for sure. Anyways, give it a try, generate some posts or clone it if you wish. It is public, you can check it, use it for free for your own advantage. The app mostly targets content creators, brands and digital marketers.
